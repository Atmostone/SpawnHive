"""Experiment report assembly (SPA-40).

Turns the settled matrix of an experiment into the report views: per-config
summary, quality-profile heatmap (configs × rubric dimensions), Pareto
frontier (quality ↑ × cost ↓ × time ↓), outcome × trajectory scatter, a
pairwise leaderboard derived from pointwise scores (E-19 ``build_matches`` +
``rank``), statistical significance per config pair (Welch primary,
Mann-Whitney as the non-parametric check), failure-mode breakdown, and the
orchestrator on/off comparison.

``build_report`` is pure given pre-loaded rows; ``compute_report`` is the
DB-bound convenience that loads them. The API caches the result into
``experiments.report`` once the experiment is terminal.
