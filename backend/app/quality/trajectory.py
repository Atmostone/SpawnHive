"""6-axis Trajectory Judge (E-07).

Outcome evaluation (E-02) answers "how good is the result", not "how the agent
got there". A correct answer reached by a 12-step trajectory that should have
been 4 steps is "🤷 lucky": such agents are expensive and unstable. This module
adds the second axis — trajectory.

It takes the cleaned trace from E-06 (`build_cleaned_trace`) and, in a SINGLE
LLM call, scores the whole trajectory on six axes (§5.2 of EVALUATION_FRAMEWORK):
efficiency, tool_selection, parameter_quality, error_recovery, goal_alignment,
loop_detection — each 0-10 with a required reason — plus a one-line summary. The
profile is written to ``quality_records.trajectory_profile`` (next to E-02's
outcome ``quality_profile``).

Consistent with the rest of `app.quality`, the judge never raises: an LLM or
parse failure becomes ``status: "error"`` instead of an exception, and the
endpoint still answers. Cost is bounded by the configurable
``trajectory_judge_max_input_tokens`` setting (the cleaned trace is trimmed to
fit before the call). Model selection reuses E-02's resolver
(`quality_judge` → `orchestrator`).
