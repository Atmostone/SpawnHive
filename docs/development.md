# Development

## Running locally

Requirements: Docker + docker compose v2.

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd SpawnHive
cp .env.example .env   # edit LLM_BASE_URL/API_KEY
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
```

UI: http://localhost:3002 — Vite dev (HMR).
API: http://localhost:8001 — FastAPI behind nginx LB.
OpenAPI: http://localhost:8001/docs.

## Services

| Service | Host port | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| nginx | 8001 | Reverse proxy / load balancer for the api replicas |
| api | — (expose 8000) | FastAPI; REST + WS only (orchestrator/scheduler are separate) |
| orchestrator | — | Polling loop; holds advisory lock 8723451 |
| scheduler | — | APScheduler; holds advisory lock 8723452 |
| frontend | 3002 | Vite dev (3001 was taken by another project on the host) |
| postgres | 5432 | |
| qdrant | 6333 / 6334 | |
| minio | 9000 / 9001 | console on :9001 |
| redis | — | Pub/sub for cross-replica WS event fan-out |

## Agent image

```bash
docker build -t spawnhive-agent:latest agent-image/
```

Rebuild whenever `agent-image/*.py` or `requirements.txt` changes. The API uses this image through the Docker socket.

## Migrations

Create a new one:

```bash
docker compose exec api alembic revision -m "what changed"
# edit backend/alembic/versions/<rev>.py — fill in upgrade/downgrade
docker compose exec api alembic upgrade head
```

Roll back the last one:

```bash
docker compose exec api alembic downgrade -1
```

**Rule:** every PR that adds a migration must include a working `downgrade`. CI enforces a round-trip migration test.

## Tests

```bash
docker compose exec api pytest                 # full suite
docker compose exec api pytest --cov=app       # with coverage
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces `--cov-fail-under=60`. Conftest creates `spawnhive_test` DB; if missing, run `docker compose exec postgres createdb -U spawnhive spawnhive_test` once.

## Useful curl commands (after R1)

```bash
# Register / login — obtain a JWT
TOK=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"me@example.com","password":"strongpass1","display_name":"Me"}' \
  | jq -r .access_token)

# Create a task
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"do X","priority":"high","description":"…"}'

# Move it to ready (orchestrator picks it up)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/api/tasks/<id> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"status":"ready"}'

# Approve after awaiting_approval
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/api/tasks/<id>/approve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK"

# Slash command via WS chat (token in query string)
echo '{"content":"/status"}' \
  | websocat "ws://localhost:8001/ws/chat?token=$TOK"

# Memory entities
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" http://localhost:8001/api/memory/entities | jq .
```

After R1, every endpoint except `/api/auth/*`, `/api/health`, `/api/v1/agent-webhook/*` returns 401 without `Authorization`.

## JWT_SECRET

`.env` must contain `JWT_SECRET=<64-byte hex>`. Generate one with `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(64))"`. The placeholder in `.env.example` is for dev only — replace it with your own value.

## Where to look at logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f api          # backend
docker compose logs -f frontend     # vite
docker logs <agent-container-id>    # individual agent
```

All events are also written to `agent_events`; query them via `/api/events?...` or the WebSocket.

## AI assistant instructions

See the root `CLAUDE.md`. It doesn't contradict this folder — it just lists short working rules (style, DRY/KISS, ask before picking models, docker-only runs).

## Pre-PR checklist

1. ✅ Migration (if needed) with working upgrade and downgrade.
2. ✅ Relevant files in `docs/` are updated.
3. ✅ `pytest` is green and coverage stays at or above 60% (CI gate).
4. ✅ No new workarounds without a `docs/workarounds.md` entry.
5. ✅ No backwards-compatibility shims "just in case".
6. ✅ No stubs/mocks left in production code.
