"""Deterministic loop / repetition detection over a cleaned trace (E-07 anchor).

The E-07 trajectory judge scores a ``loop_detection`` axis, but that score is the
LLM's freestyle opinion over a *budget-trimmed* trace — and the project's own
calibration found that axis the most miscalibrated (judge mean 4.38 vs human
8.13). This module is the deterministic, LLM-free counterpart: it **counts**
actual repetition structurally over the full, untrimmed step LIST (no step is
dropped before counting — unlike the judge, which scores the budget-trimmed
trace; note each step's *content* may already be output-capped by E-06, which
does not affect duplicate detection). The report shows the counted loop rate
next to the judge's opinion and uses the counted signal to anchor the LLM axis.

This is a **precision-oriented structural lower bound over tool-calls**, not a
universal loop oracle: it counts only tool actions (reasoning loops are out of
scope) and catches exact / cyclic repetition, so it may *under-count* semantic
loops that vary their wording. It is built to be confident when it fires, and to
be the floor the LLM axis is measured against.

Two complementary structural signals over the agent's tool-call sequence:

1. **Exact stuck-repeat** — the longest run of *consecutive identical actions*
   (same tool_name AND same normalized content), e.g. the same failing call
   retried verbatim. Content-aware, so genuine progress (same tool, different
   content) is not flagged.
2. **Tandem tool cycles** — a contiguous repeated n-gram over the tool-name
   sequence with period ≥ 2, e.g. ``search → click → search → click → search →
   click``. Found by a phase-aware global scan (every (period, start)), so a
   cycle that begins after an unaligned prefix is not missed.

Pure and total: ``detect_loops`` never raises (mirrors ``trace_cleaner`` /
``trajectory`` error discipline) — on any unexpected input it returns the
no-loop result. Stores only hashes/short tool names, never raw content.
