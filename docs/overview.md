# SpawnHive — Overview

## What it is

A self-hosted platform for orchestrating specialised AI agents. It takes a task → picks an agent template → spawns an isolated Docker container → the agent solves the task using its built-in tools and MCP servers → the result goes to review → the user approves/rejects.

## Who it's for

- Developers and researchers who need several narrowly-specialised agents for different tasks (research, coding, writing, devops…) under a single control plane.
- Teams who want self-hosting (privacy, control over models, customisation).
- People who want a visual orchestration layer on top of litellm/MCP without vendor lock-in.

## What makes it different

- **Templates as agent roles**: each template is `(model, soul_md, tools, mcp_servers, limits)`. The LLM provider can be overridden per template.
- **Structured Memory**: automatic extraction of entities/relations from task results, embedding-based dedup, relevant sub-graph injected into the agent.
- **Bidirectional control**: the orchestrator can send feedback / abort / switch_model into a live agent container.
- **MCP-first**: custom MCP servers plug in per template without code changes.
- **Local-first**: everything runs in Docker Compose; nothing leaves the host.

## Tech stack

| Layer | What |
|-------|------|
| Backend API | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy async + Alembic |
| Storage | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Vector | Qdrant |
| Object storage | MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| LLM abstraction | litellm |
| Embeddings | fastembed (local) or an OpenAI-compatible API |
| Scheduler | APScheduler |
| Agent runtime | Docker (via docker-py + socket mount) |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + TanStack Query |
| Graph viz | reactflow |
| Default LLM | MiniMax-M2.7 (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint is supported) |

## Status

- ✅ Core MVP loop: kanban → orchestrator → agent → review → approve.
- ✅ 11 default agent templates.
- ✅ RAG (PDF/DOCX/MD/TXT), MCP servers, kill switch, kanban, chat WebSocket.
- ✅ Pre-backlog (P0–P14): structured memory, bidirectional channel, periodic progress, Pydantic webhook schemas, per-template model routing, cost calculation, analytics + reasoning trail, priority in polling, APScheduler, depends_on in decomposition, audit log, workspace_id labels (stub), per-agent WS, slash commands, versioned templates.

## What's next

See [`production-readiness-tz.md`](production-readiness-tz.md) — work to be done **before** the main `BACKLOG.md` starts. After that — backlog features (visual A2A graph, benchmarks, replay, explainability, etc.).
