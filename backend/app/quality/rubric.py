"""Rubrics for the Multi-dimensional Quality Rubric Engine (E-02).

A rubric is a set of independent quality dimensions. ``DEFAULT_RUBRICS`` are the
built-ins seeded into the default workspace (and cloned to each new one);
``resolve_rubric_for_task`` picks the rubric to score a task with.

Each dimension declares its own evaluator. Only ``judge`` (LLM-as-judge) is wired
today; ``objective`` (E-04) and ``human`` (E-05) are valid in the schema but
scored as ``deferred`` until those subsystems land. The defaults therefore use
``judge`` everywhere so the profile is fully populated out of the box.
